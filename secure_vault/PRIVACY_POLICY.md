**Last Updated: January 17, 2026**

**Developer: Analogte**

## Introduction

Analogte ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Secure Vault mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.

**Your privacy is our top priority.** Secure Vault is designed with a privacy-first approach, using client-side encryption to ensure that only you can access your files.

---

## Summary

- **We do NOT collect your personal data**
- **We do NOT have access to your files or passwords**
- **All encryption happens on your device**
- **Your data never leaves your device without your explicit action**

---

## 1. Information Collection

### 1.1 Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do **NOT** collect your personal information
- We do **NOT** collect your files, photos, or documents
- We do **NOT** collect your passwords or encryption keys
- We do **NOT** use analytics or tracking services
- We do **NOT** collect device identifiers for advertising

### 1.2 Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is stored **only on your device** and is **never transmitted** to us:

| Data Type | Purpose | Storage Location |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Encrypted files | Your secured files and photos | Device storage |
| Encrypted file names | Protect file identity | Device storage |
| Vault metadata | Manage your vaults | Local database |
| Encryption keys | Decrypt your files | Secure device storage |
| App settings | Your preferences | Local storage |

### 1.3 Biometric Data

If you enable biometric authentication (fingerprint/face):
- Biometric data is processed **entirely by your device's operating system**
- We **never** access, store, or transmit your biometric information
- We only receive a success/failure response from the system

---

## 2. How Your Data is Protected

### 2.1 Client-Side Encryption

All encryption and decryption happens **exclusively on your device**:

- **Encryption Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM (military-grade encryption)
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Your password:** Never stored, only used to derive encryption keys
- **Master key:** Encrypted and stored locally, inaccessible without your password

### 2.2 Zero-Knowledge Architecture

We operate on a **zero-knowledge** principle:
- We cannot decrypt your files
- We cannot recover your password
- We cannot access your data even if legally requested (we don't have it)

### 2.3 Local-Only Storage

- All data remains on your device
- No cloud synchronization (unless you explicitly enable it in future versions)
- No backup to external servers

---

## 3. Data Sharing

### 3.1 We Do NOT Share Your Data

We do not sell, trade, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.

### 3.2 Third-Party Services

The App may use the following third-party services for functionality:

| Service | Purpose | Data Shared |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Google Play Services | App distribution and updates | None from our app |
| Device File System | Store encrypted files | Local only |
| Device Biometrics | Authentication | None (system-level) |

---

## 4. Your Rights and Choices

### 4.1 Data Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** All your data is on your device, accessible only with your password
- **Delete:** Delete any file or vault at any time
- **Export:** Export your decrypted files whenever you want
- **Uninstall:** Removing the app deletes all app data from your device

### 4.2 Password Recovery

**Important:** We cannot recover your password. If you forget your password:
- Your encrypted data cannot be recovered
- There is no "forgot password" feature
- This is by design to ensure maximum security

---

## 5. Data Retention

- **While using the app:** Data is stored locally on your device
- **Deleted files:** Moved to trash, permanently deleted after 30 days (or manually)
- **After uninstalling:** All app data is removed from your device

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since we don't collect any personal information from any users, this naturally extends to children as well.

---

## 7. Security Measures

We implement the following security measures:

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for all files
- **PBKDF2 key derivation** with high iteration count
- **Secure storage** for encryption keys
- **Auto-lock** feature to protect against unauthorized access
- **Screenshot prevention** option
- **Biometric authentication** support
- **No network transmission** of your data

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Providing a notice within the App for significant changes

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

---

## 9. Open Source

Secure Vault's security model is transparent:
- Encryption is performed using industry-standard, open-source libraries
- No proprietary encryption algorithms are used
- Security can be audited and verified
